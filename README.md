#Instruction
1.	First, when I looked at the example in the zip file, I found that the example data got an ID for each city, which I did not have. I researched online, got the code for adding ID, and made it on the fastest left side.
2.	When I worked on the part of humidity vs. latitude, I always got a negative slope for the regression line, which differs from the example. And I asked three different learning assistants. Finally, we claimed that it is due to the size of a random city, not the problem of codes.
3.	When I worked on VacationPy, I failed to import folium. I learned from the web and got code from there.
4.	When I configured the map, I found that the city spots were big on the map, therefore I researched and got code like “dim(“Humidity) *0.1”. Then the problem was solved.
    
#Declaration 
During the task, I used some syntax, formulas, and functions. Some of them are from class, and some of them are from a web search. When I made an error or had no idea what was going on, I chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. I figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed the code down. From this view, my work might have some similarities with others. I am a new learner of coding, have to do lots of research and reading for problem-solving.
